# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

## This is a quiz app, it's built with react using tests 

The functionality is to use mockData, with questions and 4 alternatives / choices to choose from with only one being right for the current question, and 3 being wrong answers.
After the questions have all been submitted show a score and answers for which questions was correct or wrong

It's a basic create-react-app project and I've used basic jsx and sass for styling in this project 

All tests can be found in the /src/__test__ dir

# Components and Features to include ðŸ’¾
- Header (with a title)
- Quiz component, handles state for currentQuiz, selectedAnswers and score, its is the wrapper for QuizHeader & QuizQuestions, passes the data
    - QuizHeader component is where the question is shown as title, passed in as props from data
    - QuizQuestion, handles submit and is a list wrapper for QuizChoices rendering the choices, passed in as props from data
- QuizChoice component should contain a choice ex, li with input and label, takes in props from data

There should be data for this project and I'll give an example here, to make it easier.
