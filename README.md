# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

## This is a quiz app, it's built with react using tests 

The functionality is to use mockData, with questions and 4 alternatives / choices to choose from with only one being right and 3 being wrong answers, 
after the questions have all been submitted show a score and answers for which questions was corrent or wrong

It's a basic create-react-app project and I've used basic jsx and sass for styling in this project 

All tests can be found in the /src/__test__ dir
